  # A list of resource collection configurations.
  # Consists of a name_pattern and an entity_name.
  # The name_pattern is a pattern to describe the names of the resources of this
  # collection, using the platform's conventions for URI patterns. A generator
  # may use this to generate methods to compose and decompose such names. The
  # pattern should use named placeholders as in `shelves/{shelf}/books/{book}`;
  # those will be taken as hints for the parameter names of the generated
  # methods. If empty, no name methods are generated.
  # The entity_name is the name to be used as a basis for generated methods and
  # classes.

  # A list of method configurations.
  # Common properties:
  #   name - The simple name of the method.
  #   flattening - Specifies the configuration for parameter flattening.
  #       Describes the parameter groups for which a generator should produce
  #       method overloads which allow a client to directly pass request message
  #       fields as method parameters. This information may or may not be used,
  #       depending on the target language.
  #       Consists of groups, which each represent a list of parameters to be
  #       flattened. Each parameter listed must be a field of the request
  #       message.
  #   required_fields - Fields that are always required for a request to be
  #       valid.
  #   request_object_method - Turns on or off the generation of a method whose
  #       sole parameter is a request object. Not all languages will generate
  #       this method.
  #   page_streaming - Specifies the configuration for paging.
  #       Describes information for generating a method which transforms a
  #       paging list RPC into a stream of resources.
  #       Consists of a request and a response.
  #       The request specifies request information of the list method. It
  #       defines which fields match the paging pattern in the request. The
  #       request consists of a page_size_field and a token_field. The
  #       page_size_field is the name of the optional field specifying the
  #       maximum number of elements to be returned in the response. The
  #       token_field is the name of the field in the request containing the
  #       page token.
  #       The response specifies response information of the list method. It
  #       defines which fields match the paging pattern in the response. The
  #       response consists of a token_field and a resources_field. The
  #       token_field is the name of the field in the response containing the
  #       next page token. The resources_field is the name of the field in the
  #       response containing the list of resources belonging to the page.
  #   retry_codes_name - Specifies the configuration for retryable codes. The
  #       name must be defined in interfaces.retry_codes_def.
  #   retry_params_name - Specifies the configuration for retry/backoff
  #       parameters. The name must be defined in interfaces.retry_params_def.
  #   field_name_patterns - Maps the field name of the request type to
  #       entity_name of interfaces.collections.
  #       Specifies the string pattern that the field must follow.
  #   timeout_millis - Specifies the default timeout for a non-retrying call. If
  #       the call is retrying, refer to retry_params_name instead.
